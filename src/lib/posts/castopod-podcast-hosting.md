excerpt: Be your own podcast host using Castopod.
title: Castopod Podcast Hosting
---
One of my main goals while starting the Podcasting 4 Value podcast is to create a system that allows complete control of one's content. File hosting is one of the main components to creating a podcast. There are many options out there for sure. Most take complete control over you content. With most of the hosting options I have seen they control your RSS feed, file hosting and sometimes even advertising. Let me hit the brakes here for a moment and say that I am by no means an expert in any of this. My aim is to be very knowledgeable about the realm of podcasting going forward, but I am at the beginning of my journey. In the future I plan on doing at least one episode on options for hosting/managing a podcast. 

At the present I am hosting my sound files on PCloud. I have used them for about a year and it has been good. It was a one time payment and now I have a 2TB of lifetime online storage. My Google Drive/Dropbox solution is a Nextcloud server and I back that up to PCloud as well. PCloud is not open source or free, but it does allow me control over my data. This post is not about cloud storage (well not entirely), it is about a creator having control over their content. This is where Castopod comes in.

According to the Castopod website located [here](https://castopod.org/): 

"Self-host your podcasts with ease, keep control over what you create and talk to your audience without any middleman. Your podcast and your audience belong to you and you only."

Now this sounds pretty well spot on with what I am looking for. A way to centralize content with personal control over all of it. The only bugaboo with that quote is in the first sentence, "Self-host your podcasts with ease..". I like to self-host just about everything, but it is seldom with ease. 

This software is still in the Beta phase (translation: expect some bugs and issues)
